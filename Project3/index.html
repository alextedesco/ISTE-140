                <p>The debates of concussions have been brought back up by the media recently and it sparked debate
                    regarding when it is being too cautious to pull a player from a game to the point where it
                    drastically impacts
                    the outcome of a game. Player safety should be a priority in sports but when players are removed
                    after
                    showing minimal symptoms, is that being too cautious.

                <p>Kanye has recently been under fire for a flurry of statements he
                    has made over the past month. He has appeared in several interviews
                    in order to try to clear the air and explain what made him say what
                    he said. However, in every interview, he was upset that it was
                    never considered what made him say what he did.

                <p>Countries across the world have laws that govern the way that
                    not only their government functions but also laws that protect
                    the people. The question that needs answering is â€œWhat is the
                    right way to deal with those who break these laws while still
                    allowing them to maintain their humanity?
