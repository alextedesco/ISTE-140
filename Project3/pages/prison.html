        </header>

        <article><h2>Introduction</h2>Countries across the world have laws that govern the way that not only their government functions but also laws that protect the people. The question that needs answering is “What is the right way to deal with those who break these laws while still allowing them to maintain their humanity? In this article, we will be focusing specifically on America’s crime rates and how we engage with incarcerated individuals. We will also be comparing it to other countries and considering if it is effective or not. There are several variables that we can look at to rate the effectiveness of the policy currently in place.

            <h2>Cruel and Unusual Punishment</h2>
            <p>What do prisons look like? What is the state of living in these institutions? The answer? BAD. The eighteenth amendment states that prisoners should not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. One of the questions currently being debated is whether the current state of prison systems crosses this line. Researchers studying the benefits of rehabilitative incarceration say yes. We have. From the quality of food and testimonies saying much of it is unrecognizable to lack of proper treatment for infectious diseases, the state of prisons are hardly livable.</p>

            <h2>War On Drugs</h2>
            <p>The war on drugs was a declaration President Nixon made in 1971 where he stated that drug abuse was “public enemy number one” and had to be dealt with. This was in result of an increase in drug-related deaths around that period. Even so, this is considered to have been pushed during the Reagan administration in 1981. This triggered a rise in drug-related incarcerations in the United States. As we continue to deal with a nationwide opioid crisis it begs the question, “Is the war on drugs working?”. And the answer is…kinda? According to The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring the Causes and Consequences by Jeremy Travis. Bruce Western, and Steve Redburn, there was a decrease in crime following an increase in incarceration rates and an increase in the length of sentences. However, it is so minute that it is generally thought that it is because anyone who would commit a crime again is locked up and not in the world and not that there is effective rehabilitation happening. Not only is this method ineffective and does not allow drug users and other criminals to lead a normal life following incarceration (if they even get out) but it also targets minority groups specifically</p>
            <h2>Current US Prison Statistics</h2>
            <p>Over the past 100 years, the US Federal prison Population has increased tenfold. We have the highest number of incarcerated individuals in the world. On top of this, people are serving significantly LONGER terms. Incarcerated individuals are serving sentences 3 times longer than they were 40 years ago. But why? There are a couple of theories. One of them is the War on drugs.</p>
            <h2>Race and Class</h2>
            <p>It has become evident that the war on drugs targets specifically those in ethnic minority groups as well as those in lower-income communities. As stated in the growth of incarceration in the united states, “Among white male high school dropouts born in the late 1970s, about one-third are estimated to have served time in prison by their mid-30s. Yet incarceration rates have reached even higher levels among young black men with little schooling: among black male high school dropouts, about two-thirds have a prison record by that same age— more than twice the rate for their white counterparts.” (Travis et al., 5) On top of that, according to the sentencing project 1 in 9 men will be imprisoned. 1 in 17 white men will be incarcerated compared to 1 in 3 Black men and 1 in 6 Latinx Men. These are coming from oppressed communities. The most disadvantaged sections of society. Many people within these communities also find themselves stuck in low-income communities without the resources to navigate themselves out of these situations. As a product of this many people within these communities do not have access to health services and therefore are likely entering prisons, not of sound mind or body. These types of conditions can be a major factor in whether someone commits a crime in the first place. The physical and mental state of incarcerated individuals just highlights the necessity for a rehabilitation-based system as opposed to a punishment-based system. The release of criminals still within the same mental and physical space (if not worse) leads to higher rates of re-offense. This is what contributes to the high population of incarcerated individuals in The US.</p>
