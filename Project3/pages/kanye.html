            <h1>The Artist Formerly Known as ‘Kanye West’</h1>
        </header>

        <article>The artist formerly known as ‘Kanye West’ or Ye has recently been under fire for a flurry of statements he has made over the past month. He has appeared in several interviews in order to try to clear the air and explain what made him say what he said. However, in every interview, he was upset that it was never considered what made him say what he did.

        <section class="section1">
            <p>Most recently, a fan did a quick interview with Ye where Ye had seemingly gone fully into the idea that the industry is fully corrupt and that Jewish power in the media is colluding with Jewish power in music and fashion when the reality is likely that nobody is willing to provide him the stage where he will more than likely spread these same ideas. “Exactly what I had claimed they were gonna do has started to be done, you saw they took down the interviews, they tried to sound byte everything up, and they tried to not understand what our frustrations are.”</p>

        <section class="section2">
            <p>Ye unleashed more anger on the U.S. government saying, “What they do is take the Black community and they separate us, they separate the families.” Referring to the pressure his mom went through with her colleagues at Chicago State University, to cut ties with his father, for reasons Ye does not get into other than blaming higher education.</p>

                    In October of 2022, a fan conducted an interview with Ye in a outside of an unknown building. In the

                <li>
                    Ye was a guest on the Lex Fridman Podcast on October 24th, 2022 to discuss a variety of topics,

                <li>
                    On October 26th, 2022 Ye did an informal interview in a parking lot with a fan where he discussed
                    how
                    his story has been hidden from the public and control over his companies.

        <aside>
            <p>When asked about his ‘death con 3’ tweet on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Ye argued, “I was going to talk about all of the contracts, all of the missed dealings, that I dealt with as an entertainer. Being that I'm an entertainer I've been wronged so many times by Jewish businessmen.” Fridman then explained to Ye the pain he caused when he generalized all Jewish people and recommended Ye to speak directly about who has wronged him. Although this initially angered Ye, he has since followed Fridman's advice, and, in typical fahion, revealed texts from his personal trainer, Harley Pasternak.</p>
