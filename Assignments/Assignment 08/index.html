            <h2>About Elon Musk</h2>

            <p><strong>Elon Reeve Musk FRS</strong> is a naturalized American business magnate and investor.
                He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, and product architect
                of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an
                estimated net worth of around US$262 billion as of September 10, 2022, Musk is the wealthiest person
                in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="early_life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>

            <h3>Childhood and Family</h3>

            <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of South Africa, and
                was baptized into an Anglican church. Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother is
                Maye Musk, a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada and raised in South Africa. His father is
                Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
                developer
                who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother Kimbal
                (born 1972) and a younger sister Tosca (born 1974).
            </p>

            <p>Musk's family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a
                representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children reportedly sharing their
                father's dislike of apartheid. His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous
                American-born
                Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa
                and Australia. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father. Musk later
                regretted
                his decision as he has become estranged from his father. He has a paternal half-sister and a
                half-brother.
            </p>

            <p>In his biography, Ashlee Vance described Musk as an awkward and introverted child. When Musk was 10, he
                developed an interest in computing and video games, so he brought a Commodore VIC-20 and taught himself
                programming from an user manual. At age 12, he sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office
                Technology
                magazine for approximately $500.
            </p>


            <h3>Education</h3>

            <p>He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School and graduated from Pretoria Boys
                High School. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it
                would
                be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While waiting for the documentation, he attended
                the
                University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African
                Defence Force.
            </p>

            <p>Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working
                odd
                jobs at a farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years
                later,
                he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts
                degree in
                physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in 1995.
            </p>

            <p>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one is at the energy storage startup Pinnacle
                Research
                Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another is at the
                Palo
                Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)
                program
                in materials science at Stanford University. However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom instead and
                applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.

            <h2>Business Career</h2>

            <h3>Zip2</h3>

            <p>Later in 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri borrowed funds from Musk's father and
                founded Zip2. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, yellow pages,
                and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto, with Musk coding
                the website in every night. Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the
                Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;
                however, Musk's attempts to become CEO himself were thwarted. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million
                in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>

            <p>Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.
                X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks and over 200,000 customers joined after
                its initial months of operation. Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as
                inexperienced and replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.
            </p>

            <p>In 2000, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition as Confinity's money-transfer
                service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service. Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company.
                His preference for Microsoft over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees and
                Peter Thiel, Confinity's founder, to resign. In addition to compounding technological issues and a lack
                of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.
                Under Thiel, the company focused on the money transfer service and renamed as PayPal in 2001.
            </p>

            <p>The next year, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest
                shareholder
                with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million. More than one and a half decades later, Musk purchased
                the
                domain X.com from PayPal in 2017 because of his personal sentimental value.
            </p>

            <h3>SpaceX</h3>

            <div class="spacex">
                <figure>
                    <img class="scaleable limited-250" src="images/spaceX_logo.png" alt="Space X Logo">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place
                a
                growth-chamber for plants on Mars. In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell
                and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the
                greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was
                seen as a novice and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the
                group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had
                another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He
                instead
                decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune,
                Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.
            </p>

            <p>SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. Though the rocket failed to reach Earth
                orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA
                Administrator
                (and former SpaceX consultant) Mike Griffin later that year. After two more failed attempts that
                nearly caused Musk and his companies to bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit
                in
                2008. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from
                NASA
                for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station,
                replacing the
                Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a
                private enterprise. Musk credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA
                Administrator, for saving the company.
            </p>

            <p>Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a
                Falcon 9
                on an inland platform. Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based
                recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's
                personal
                Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload. Since 2019, SpaceX is developing Starship, a fully-reusable,
                super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Heavy. In 2020, SpaceX launched its
                first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and
                dock
                a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.
            </p>

            <p>SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide
                satellite Internet access, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second
                set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May
                2019,
                when the first 60 operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the decade-long project to
                design,
                build, and deploy the constellation is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion. Some critics,
                including
                the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a
                collision
                threat for spacecraft. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink systems to
                Ukraine
                to provide internet access and communication, an action praised by Ukrainian president Volodymyr
                Zelenskyy.
                However, he refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself "a free speech
                absolutist."

            <h3>Tesla</h3>

            <div class="tesla">
                <figure>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who
                financed
                the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early
                development
                prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested
                $6.5 million,
                became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active
                role
                within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day
                business operations.
            </p>

            <p>Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted
                from the
                firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009
                lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two
                others.
                As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021 Musk
                nominally
                changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.
            </p>

            <p>Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it
                was the
                first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. Tesla began delivery of its
                four-door Model S sedan in 2012. A cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015. A mass market
                sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017. The Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric
                car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.
                A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020. The Cybertruck—an all-electric pickup
                truck—was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and
                electric vehicle factories named Gigafactories.

            <p>Since its initial public offering in 2010, Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most
                valuable
                carmaker in summer 2020, and it entered the S&P 500 later that year. In October 2021 it
                reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in US history. On November 6,
                2021,
                Musk proposed on Twitter selling 10% of his Tesla stock, since "much is made lately of unrealized gains
                being a means
                of tax avoidance". After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9
                billion of
                Tesla stock in the week ending November 12, and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10%
                target.
                In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Elon and Kimbal Musk were under
                investigation by the SEC for
                possible insider trading related to the sale.

            <h3>Neuralink</h3>

            <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company with an investment of $100 million.
                Neuralink
                aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are
                embedded in the
                brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices
                to
                communicate with software. The company also hopes to develop devices that treat neurological conditions
                like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.
            </p>

            <p>In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human
                brain. At a
                2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that
                could soon cure
                paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized
                these claims,
                with MIT Technology Review describing them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater".
                During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity
                related to smell.
            </p>

            <p>Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on Macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis'
                Primate Research Center.
                In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink
                implant. The company's
                animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—has led to claims of animal cruelty. The
                Physicians Committee for
                Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act. In
                2022, Neuralink
                announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. Musk is listed as the sole author of
                an October 2019
                paper detailing some of Neuralink's research, although him being the sole author rankled the Neuralink
                team's researchers.
            </p>

            <h3>OpenAI</h3>

            <p>In 2015, Musk founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit AI research company aiming to develop artificial general
                intelligence
                intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. A particular focus of the company is to democratize
                artificial
                superintelligence systems against governments and corporations. In 2018, Musk left the
                OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the company
                increasingly
                became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot. Since then, the organization has made significant
                advancement
                in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text) and DALL-E
                (generate
                digital images from natural language descriptions).
            </p>

            <h3>The Boring Company</h3>

            <p>In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels. Musk revealed plans for specialized high
                occupancy
                vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour, circumventing above-ground traffic in major cities.
                Early in
                2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1
                m) wide,
                50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it
                required no permits.
                The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla
                Model X's and was
                reported to be a rough ride and travel at suboptimal speeds.
            </p>

            <p>Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been cancelled. However, a
                tunnel beneath
                the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further
                expansions of the
                tunnel system. In 2021, tunnel construction was approved for Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
